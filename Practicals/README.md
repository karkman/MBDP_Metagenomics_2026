## Introduction

During the course we will analyse metagenomic data from soils collected in Kilpisjärvi, Finland. The data originates from the publication: [ZZZ](LINK) and are available in SRA under accession number XXX.  
The samples were sequenced with both short-read (Illumina) and long-read (Nanopore) sequencing technologies, but for training purposes, we will focus on only a subset of of the data, 2 nanopore sequenced samples (ERR5000342 and ERR5000343) and 6 Illumina sequenced samples (ERR5000342, ERR5000343, ERR5000344, ERR5000345, ERR5000346, and ERR5000347). The data are already available on Puhti for the course analyses.
The matching samples sequenced with both technologies are ...

## Setup

First create your wn working directory under the course project directory on Puhti, e.g.:

```bash
mkdir /scratch/project_2001499/$USER
```
NOTE: change ```$USER``` to your directory name.

After that, clone this github reposoitory to your directory and check that you have access to the files:

```bash
cd /scratch/project_2001499/$USER   
git clone https://github.com/MBDP-bioinformatics-courses/MBDP_Metagenomics_2026.git
```

## Data

When the course github pages are cloned, create folder for the course data and copy the data from the course project directory to your own directory:
We will make separate folders for short- and long-read data.

```bash
mkdir /scratch/project_2001499/$USER/01_DATA/short_read
mkdir /scratch/project_2001499/$USER/01_DATA/long_read

cp -r /scratch/project_2001499/XXX /scratch/project_2001499/$USER/01_DATA/short_read
cp -r /scratch/project_2001499/XXX /scratch/project_2001499/$USER/01_DATA/long_read
```

After copying, verify that you have the right data in your directory with ```ls```.

```
NOTE: change ```$USER``` to your directory name.

### Identifying viral contigs using geNomad

There are many different tools for predicting viral contigs from metagenomes. In this course, we will use geNomad. [Read about it](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-023-01953-y) and check its [GitHub pages](https://github.com/apcamargo/genomad). Good documentation also [here](https://portal.nersc.gov/genomad/pipeline.html). How does it work?

Note that geNomad needs its database, which is already downloaded to ```/scratch/project_2001499/DBs/``` (and it's also specified in the batch job script below).

**Running geNomad**

In your 04_VIROMICS directory, create a sample list (*sample_list.txt*), which will have sample names:
```
ERR5000342
ERR5000343
```
Make a directory for geNomad output:
```
mkdir /scratch/project_2001499/$USER/04_VIROMICS/GENOMAD/
```
Create a batch job script (*genomad.sh*) in SCRIPTS using this example (check all paths and change if needed!):
```
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=gm
#SBATCH --time=06:00:00
#SBATCH --partition=small
#SBATCH --account=project_2001499
#SBATCH --mem=10G
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4
#SBATCH --gres=nvme:50

export PATH="/projappl/project_2001499/genomad/bin:$PATH" 

export OMP_NUM_THREADS=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK

while read i
do
genomad end-to-end \
--cleanup \
--splits 16 \
/scratch/project_2001499/$USER/02_ASSEMBLY/${i}_flye/assembly.fasta \
/scratch/project_2001499/$USER/04_VIROMICS/GENOMAD/${i} \
/scratch/project_2001499/DBs/genomad_db \
--threads $SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK &> /scratch/project_2001499/$USER/00_LOGS/genomad_${i}.log
done < $1
```
Submit the job:
```
sbatch /path-to/genomad.sh /path-to/sample_list.txt
```

Check the used options (and others) by ```genomad -h``` and ```genomad end-to-end -h```. Remember to enter ```export PATH="/projappl/project_2001499/genomad/bin:$PATH"```first.

Note that we used a while loop in this example, how does it work? What other options do you have if you need to run the same tool for multiple samples?

**geNomad output**

Explore the output you got. Have a look at the log files first: 
- What steps did geNomad run? 
- How many viral contigs were identified in each sample? How about plasmids? 
 
Find summary tables for each sample, where viral contigs are listed: 
- What viral taxa were predicted? 
- Any RNA viruses? Can they be here?
- What length do viral contigs have? What length is a bacteriophage genome on average vs other viral groups such as giant viruses? 
- Are there proviruses predicted? 

### Quality control with CheckV
We will assess the quality and completeness of viral contigs identified by geNomad with CheckV. [Read about the tool](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-00774-7) and [how it works](https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/checkv/src/master/).

Note that CheckV needs its database, which is already downloaded to ```/scratch/project_2001499/DBs/``` (and it's also specified in the batch job script below).

Before running CheckV, we can combine geNomad viral contigs (fna files) from two samples into one set. Since some contigs may have same names in both samples, we should add a sample-based prefix first to contig names so that all headings are unique in a combined fna file:
```
cd /scratch/project_2001499/$USER/04_VIROMICS/GENOMAD/

sed "s/^>/>ERR5000342_/" ERR5000342/assembly_summary/assembly_virus.fna > ERR5000342_virus.fna

sed "s/^>/>ERR5000343_/" ERR5000343/assembly_summary/assembly_virus.fna > ERR5000343_virus.fna

cat *_virus.fna > virus_combined.fna
```
Check that prefixes were added with e.g. ```head```command and you can also check that your combined file contains the right number of sequences with ```seqkit stats```:

```
module load biokit

seqkit stats virus_combined.fna
```
**Running CheckV**

Make a directory for CheckV analyses:

```
mkdir /scratch/project_2001499/$USER/04_VIROMICS/CHECKV/
```
Run CheckV interactively:
```
cd /scratch/project_2001499/$USER/04_VIROMICS/CHECKV/

sinteractive -A project_2001499 -m 10G -c 8 

export OMP_NUM_THREADS=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK

export PATH="/projappl/project_2001499/checkv/bin:$PATH" 

checkv end_to_end \
/scratch/project_2001499/$USER/04_VIROMICS/GENOMAD/virus_combined.fna \
virus_combined_checkv.out \
-d /scratch/project_2001499/DBs/checkv-db-v1.5/ \
-t $SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK
```
Check the options you used with ```checkv -h``` and ```checkv end_to_end -h```.

Running CheckV will take a few minutes.

**CheckV output**

Explore the output, especially the summary file *quality._summary.tsv*:
- Are there any proviruses predicted? Are those contigs that were flagged as proviruses by geNomad now also flagged as proviruses by CheckV? Any new proviruses compared to geNomad predictions?*
- Are most contigs of low, medium or high quality? See how the quality corresponds to completeness.
- Are there any 100% complete viral genomes listed?
- Are there contigs with kmer_freq > 1? This indicates that the viral genome is represented multiple times in the contig, which is quite rare.
- Any warnings?

*Note that we used the geNomad output file as the input for CheckV. geNomad output .fna has proviral sequences already cut from host-derived flanking regiongs. These contigs are also renamed with provirus coordinates (e.g. ERR5000343_contig_14802|provirus_18530_57545). CheckV may not recognize them as proviruses, since they don't have host genes anymore. In some cases, however, it does flag them as proviral and thus suggests cutting them more. In addition, it can also mark as proviruses some contigs that were not recognized as proviral by geNomad. CheckV also outputs the proviruses.fna file, which contains proviral sequences cut as CheckV suggests (note contig names changes, e.g. ERR5000342_contig_11875_1 766-4342/4342). This means that in a real project, one would need to run CheckV again on proviruses for getting correct data on proviral_length, gene_count, viral_genes, host_genes, etc. Note that in the second round, CheckV may "want" to cut even more from some proviruses, but usually, it's not run more than twice. 

 (!) In a real project, CheckV output is typically used for filtering some predictions out. Common thresholds for metagenomic viral contigs include: 
- at least 1 virus gene identified by CheckV;
- host to virus gene count ratio no more than 1:1;
- length minimum of 5 kbp or 10 kbp, unless a genome is >=50% complete (but not shorter than 1 kbp anyway).
  
Different thresholds are used for metatranscriptomes.

In this course, we won't filter any viral contigs.

### Dereplicating viral contigs into vOTUs

Since some viral contigs could have been present (and assembled) in both samples, the datasets from the two samples may overalp. To dereplicate viral contigs into viral operational taxonomic units = vOTUs, which roughly correspond to viral species, we can use BLAST (as [parallel BLAST at CSC](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/blast/#usage-of-pb-parallel-blast-at-csc)) and anicalc.py and aniclust.py scripts from CheckV. Standard thresholds for dereplicating into vOTUs: 95% average nucleotide identity and 85% alignment fraction. Check [Minimum Information about an Uncultivated Virus Genome (MIUViG)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4306) for more info on how vOTU is defined.

For training purposes, we can use all viral contigs predicted by geNomad (without addittional CheckV-based filtering) for dereplicating as follows:

```
# make directory for vOTUs

mkdir /scratch/project_2001499/$USER/04_VIROMICS/vOTUs

cd /scratch/project_2001499/$USER/04_VIROMICS/vOTUs

module load biokit 

# blast viral contigs against themselves

pb blastn -dbnuc ../GENOMAD/virus_combined.fna -query ../GENOMAD/virus_combined.fna -outfmt '6 std qlen slen' -max_target_seqs 1000 -out virus_combined.tsv

# pb blast will take about 25 min

module load biopythontools

# calculate ANI values
python /projappl/project_2001499/anicalc.py -i virus_combined.tsv -o virus_combined_ani.tsv

# cluster contigs 
python /projappl/project_2001499/aniclust.py --fna ../GENOMAD/virus_combined.fna --ani virus_combined_ani.tsv --out virus_combined_clusters.tsv --min_ani 95 --min_tcov 85 --min_qcov 0

# save the first column of the tsv with clusters into a txt file => vOTUs IDs

cut -f1 virus_combined_clusters.tsv > vOTUs_IDs.txt

# extract vOTU sequences based on their IDs from the original fasta file
seqtk subseq ../GENOMAD/virus_combined.fna vOTUs_IDs.txt > vOTUs.fna

# check how the final vOTUs fasta files looks like
seqkit stats vOTUs.fna
```
How many viral contigs were predicted from two samples in total? How many were retained as vOTUs?

### Linking vOTUs to putative hosts

We will use iPHoP for linking vOTUs to their putative bacterial and archaeal hosts (note: not suitable for eukaryotic viruses). Although some viral contigs were classified as eukaryotic viruses in our dataset, we'll still include them here for training puprposes, but in a real project, you should exclude them from the iPHoP input.

iPHoP integrates multiple methods for host predictions: which ones? [Check the publication](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002083) and [documentation](https://bitbucket.org/srouxjgi/iphop/src/main/). What are these methods based on?

Note that iPHoP needs its database, which is already downloaded to ```/scratch/project_2001499/DBs/``` (and it's also specified in the batch job script below). We will run the latest version of the default database, but it is also possible to construct your own database by adding e.g. MAGs obtained from the same samples (see "Adding bacterial and/or archaeal MAGs to the host database" in [documentation](https://bitbucket.org/srouxjgi/iphop/src/main/)).

**Running iPHoP**


Sample batch job script:

```
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=iphop
#SBATCH --time=72:00:00
#SBATCH --partition=small
#SBATCH --account=project_2001499
#SBATCH --mem=100G
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=12
#SBATCH --gres=nvme:100

export PATH=/projappl/project_2001499/iphop/bin:$PATH

export OMP_NUM_THREADS=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK

iphop predict --fa_file /scratch/project_2001499/$USER/04_VIROMICS/vOTUs/vOTUs.fna \
--min_score 75 \
--db_dir /scratch/project_2001499/DBs/IPHOP_Jun_2025_pub_rw \
--out_dir /scratch/project_2001499/$USER/04_VIROMICS/IPHOP \
-t $SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK \
--single_thread_wish
```
Check the used options from manual (how to call it?).

**iPHoP output**

Explore the output. Find the *Host_prediction_to_genus_m75.csv* file. Note that we have applied the 75% cut-off threshold, which is OK for family-level predictions, but the 90% cut-off threshold should be used for genus-level predictions. In a real project, you would need to filter the predictions based on these thresholds.
- How many vOTUs got predictions (% of total)? Are there multiple predictions for some vOTUs?
- Which methods are listed as used ones?
- How many valid genus- vs family-level predictions are there? How about higher levels?
- How do host predictions match read-based taxonomic profiles of the samples? I.e., are most abundant bacterial/archaeal taxa among the predicted hosts?
